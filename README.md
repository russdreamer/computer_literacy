- [ ]  Create a local repository inside the current project folder via SourceTree
- [ ]  Create a remote repository on GitHub named "weather_repo"
- [ ]  Commit your changes into the local repo
- [ ]  Create a new branch named "place-feature" and switch to this branch 
- [ ]  Add the second line witn a country and a city into the file "weather.info", formatted: "Russia, Moscow"
- [ ]  Switch to master branch
- [ ]  Change the date and the temperature. And commit it
- [ ]  Repeat the previous step several times
- [ ]  Merge the "place-feature" branch into the "master"
- [ ]  Push changes into your remote repo on GitHub
- [ ]  Fork ["computer_literacy" repo](https://github.com/russdreamer/computer_literacy) to your GitHub account
- [ ]  Clone forked repo using SourceTree onto your computer as a separate local repo
- [ ]  Switch to "git_gui" branch
- [ ]  Add your remote "weather_repo" repository link into the text file "repo_url.txt" stored in your local "computer_literacy" repo
- [ ]  Push your changes from "computer_literacy" to the remote one on GitHub to the same branch (not master)
- [ ]  Go to "Actions" tab in your forked repo and check the last running result
- [ ]  If you see a yellow round - wait a minute, it's in progress. If it's a green check mark - Congratulations! If it's a red cross - click on it -> build -> expand an error line (likely your mistake is between dash lines as shown on the screen below)
